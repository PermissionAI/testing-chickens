This repository contains a small demo of a permission-based advertising flow.

## Running the demo

Open `demo.html` in your browser. The conversation text will prefill in the
input boxes so you can simply press **Send** to advance the scripted flow
through:

1. The user flow on `index.html`.
2. The brand portal on `brand.html`.
3. Returning to the user view to display the final offer.

The demo uses `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, so running everything in the
same browser tab will let the pages share data.
